# BigMart_Sales_Predictions
Creating BigMart Sales Predictions using Python as well as R

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across their 10 stores in different
cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. 
To build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.

Using predictive models, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales.

In this Predictive process we have used some of following algorithms as-
  1. Linear Regression
  2. Regularized Regression Models as - Lasso Regression & Ridge Regression
  3. Random Forest
  4. XGBoost Algorithm
